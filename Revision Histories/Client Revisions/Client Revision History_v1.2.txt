Client Revision History for terminal_client.py
Generated: March 23, 2025
Based on: terminal_client.py v5.0.0, prior revision logs (v2.13–v4.3.11), client_mini_revisions_20250322_v5.0.0.txt, full script v5.0.0, update notes from 2025-03-17, 2025-03-18, 2025-03-20, 2025-03-22, and operational context from user interactions.

Overview:
This revision history tracks the development of terminal_client.py for the Packet Radio Terminal Project. It includes version updates, key changes, bug fixes, and notable issues, derived from code comments, manual notes, changelog entries, provided documents, and user interactions. Dates reflect file versions or explicit log references. User workflow: edits on Windows (G:\My Drive\Game Dev\terminal\Client Scripts\), .txt suffix for safety, synced via Google Drive, deployed via SSH/nano to debian.lan (/opt/terminal_client/), backups versioned (e.g., terminal_client_v2.85.txt to v5.0.1.txt).

Version 5.0.0 (2025-03-22)
Changes:
- Updated VERSION to 5.0.0.

- Chunk 6: Updated build_ax25_packet with optional zlib compression (C flag) for G/P packets, send_to_kiss uses compression for G/P, kiss_listener handles CMS U/D sync and decompression. Added build_cms_push_index() to compute push MD5, clean_push_cache() to remove expired CMS files.
- Chunk 7: Extended main loop to handle CMS M (PUSH sync) with X|PUSH|<index>, processes L/G packets (placeholders for UI).
- General: No code removed, backups logging always on. Line count increased from ~976 (v4.3.11 reported) to ~1250 (~274 lines added per mini-revisions; script shows ~1600+).
Notes:
- Major CMS integration from 2025-03-22; user tweaked CMS updates 2025-03-22 night, unversioned but planned for testing with server v1.88 (per chat 2025-03-23). CMS sync untested in RF conditions. Line count discrepancy (~976 vs. ~1620+) suggests mini-revisions underestimated v4.3.11 baseline; script confirms ~1250 as accurate.

Version 5.0.0+ (2025-03-22 Night, Unversioned)
Changes:
- User-modified CMS updates post-v5.0.0 (exact changes unspecified in files, from chat 2025-03-23).
- Likely refined CMS sync logic or UI based on prior CMS_v0.1.txt work (G:\My Drive\Game Dev\terminal\CMS scripts\).
- Intended for testing with server v1.88 (not v4.0.0) per user plan 2025-03-23.
Notes:
- Informal update from user’s late-night session 2025-03-22; not yet archived as terminal_client_v5.0.1.txt. Awaiting test results and GitHub push.
