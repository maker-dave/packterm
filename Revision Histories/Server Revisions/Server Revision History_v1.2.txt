Overview:
This revision history tracks the development of server.py for the Packet Radio Terminal Project. It includes version updates, key changes, bug fixes, and notable issues, derived from code comments, manual notes, changelog entries, provided documents, and user interactions. Dates reflect file versions or explicit log references. User workflow: edits on Windows (G:\My Drive\Game Dev\terminal\Server scripts\), .txt suffix for safety, synced via Google Drive, deployed via SSH/nano to pi4.lan (/home/aprs/terminal/).
