Version 7 (Group 2, Document 2)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Added decode_payload function (ASCII, falls back to <non-ascii>).
- Packet log/UI now shows payload + truncated hex.
Notes:
- Improved packet readability in UI and logs.

Version 8 (Group 2, Document 3)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Fixed decode_payload end offset (len(ax25) - 3) to exclude CRC/flag.
Issues Fixed:
- Incorrect payload truncation including CRC/flag bytes.
Notes:
- Corrected payload decoding logic.

Version 9 (Group 2, Document 4)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Removed decode_payload, reverted to hex-only logging/UI.
Notes:
- Simplified back to hex for stability or preference.

Version 10 (Group 2, Document 5)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Reintroduced decode_payload with improved offset (len(ax25) - 2).
- Added detailed logging for send/forward steps in handle_kiss_client.
- Prevents loopback by skipping sender in KISS client forwarding.
Notes:
- Restored payload decoding with better offset, enhanced debugging and loopback prevention.

Version 11 (Group 2, Document 6)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Simplified status_display thread startup (no named threads).
Notes:
- Streamlined thread management.

Version 12 (Group 2, Document 7)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Reverted to v10 thread startup with named threads and IDs in log.
Notes:
- Restored detailed thread logging for troubleshooting.

Version 13 (Group 2, Document 8)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Same as v12 (no functional changes).
Notes:
- No updates; possible documentation or testing version.

Version 14 (Group 2, Document 9)
Date: 2025-03-14
Changes:
- Added direction check in peer_manager (closes inbound if IP > peer).
- Enhanced peer_server to reject inbound if local IP < peer IP.
Notes:
- Ensured single-direction peer connections based on IP ordering.

Version 15
Date: 2025-03-16
Changes:
- Added configparser import and config file setup at ~/terminal/server_data/fake_direwolf.conf.
- New logging types: log_kiss_receive_loop, log_kiss_raw_data, log_kiss_frame_parse, log_kiss_send, log_kiss_buffer_state, log_kiss_errors, log_peer_receive_loop, log_peer_raw_data, log_peer_frame_parse, log_peer_send (Lines 48-79).
- Added detailed logging in handle_kiss_client for receive loop, raw data, frame parsing, sends, buffer state, and errors (Lines 144-216).
- Added logging in handle_peer for receive loop, raw data, frame parsing, and sends (Lines 217-268).
- Updated existing logs with config toggles (e.g., LOG_BROADCAST, LOG_PEER_STATE) (Lines 80-86).
- Backup logging remains always on (Line 130).
- Line count increased from ~370 to ~430 due to config setup and additional logging.
Notes:
- Enhanced troubleshooting with configurable logging; tested with server.py v3.0.4 and terminal_client.py v4.3.5 for INDEX/FORM_UPDATE relay (20:48:01).

Version 16
Date: 2025-03-18
Changes:
- Fixed decode_payload (Lines 135-153): Adjusted payload_end to len(ax25) - 2 to exclude FCS, added log_kiss_payload_decode for extraction/decode, falls back to hex on decode failure (+5 lines est.).
- Updated parse_ax25_callsigns (Lines 117-133): Added SSID extraction with bit shifting, enhanced log_kiss_frame_parse with parsed callsign details (+3 lines est.).
- Fixed status_display (Lines 400-408): Added dynamic frame_max_len calculation (max_x - 4), capped line length at 80/max_x to prevent wrapping (+2 lines modified).
- Enhanced logging config (Lines 54-74): Added log_kiss_frame_validation, log_kiss_payload_decode, log_peer_frame_validation, log_peer_payload_decode, log_thread_management (True); turned off log_kiss_receive_loop, log_kiss_buffer_state, log_peer_receive_loop, log_ui_updates (False); kept log_kiss_raw_data, log_kiss_frame_parse, log_kiss_send, log_kiss_errors on (+5 lines est.).
- Updated logging: Added frame validation logs in handle_kiss_client and handle_peer (Lines 198, 264, +1 line each), reduced spam with conditional logging (+2 lines est.).
- Line count increased from 430 to 446 (net +16 from logging and fixes).
Issues Fixed:
- ASCII decode errors in payload due to FCS inclusion (pre-22:06:30 logs).
- Inaccurate callsign parsing without SSID (e.g., SVR001 vs. SVR001-0).
- UI line wrapping exceeding 80 columns or max_x.
Notes:
- Tested with server.py v3.0.14 and terminal_client.py v4.3.11 (22:06:30 logs); resolves decode and display issues.
