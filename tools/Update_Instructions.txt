Add fixes and updates.

Enable/add logging that may be useful in troubleshooting these issues. Use your best judgement about what could be useful.

Logging types should be able to separately be turned on and off in the config file.

Turn off logging that are not useful and could cause log spam. Backups logging always stay on.

Create a seperate mini revisions history in plain text for a txt file. Include comments about all changes. Later we will compile all mini revision histories into the main revision history.

I have attached the code to be modified to help you focus on what you're doing.

Do not remove code without permission and even then I prefer you comment out code instead of deleting.

I will be checking the number of lines of code from the code I just sent against the code you generate. If there is a significant deviation in lines expected and line produced in relation to the base code, that is a red flag that requires investigation.
Do not generate code until I say so.

Do you have any questions?
